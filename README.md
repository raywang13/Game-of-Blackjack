Game of Blackjack
This is the game of Blacjack:
The goal is to get as close to 21 without going over.
If your hand total goes over 21, you "bust."
If you get 21 on the initial deal, you get Blackjack and automatically win.

There are two players: the user and the dealer.

If the sum of the player's two initial cards is 21, the player has blackjack and immediately wins the game.
If the sum of the dealer's two initial cards is 21, the dealer has blackjack and immediately wins the game.

If the dealer's sum is less than 16 then the dealer has to take another card. 
If the sum of all the cards in the dealer's hand is greater than 21, then the dealer loses immediately and the user wins. 

As long as the user's hand total stays under 21, the user has the option to hit (get another card), or
stay (play the hand he has). If the user hits and the user's total goes over 21, then the user automatically loses
and the game ends.

The Ace is initialized with value = 11. If the total of the user/dealer's hand is over 21, then the Ace will be reduced to value =1.
